## 🧐 Project Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify and automate core banking operations.  
It provides two modules: **User** and **Admin**.  

- Users can **sign up, log in, create accounts**, and perform common banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and viewing transaction history.  
- During account creation, the system automatically generates a **unique Account Number** and a **secure PIN** for each user.  
- Admins can **monitor users, approve accounts, and track transactions**, ensuring security and smooth management of the system.  

This project is built to demonstrate how fundamental banking functions can be implemented using **Java, JDBC, and MySQL**, making it a great learning project for beginners in software development and database connectivity.
